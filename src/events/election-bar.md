## On election day, we celebrated half a year of youthful democratic activities by voting, feasting and saluting!

In order to finish off SWEET CITY in proper manner, we invited all the awesome stakeholders of the project along with the formidable young voters of Aarhus to celebrate the elections. And we dare to claim: an election with the strongest young voices we have experienced in a long, long time.

Between 16:30 and 20:00 we feasted, discussed and celebrated – before we went each of our ways to different election parties. For the occasion, we invited awesome people to contribute: _DJ Wasabi_ provided the good vibrations, _SMAG_ cooked up an enormous pot of delicious food, _SJASK_ brought along delicious bottles of natural wine and _The Institute for (X) Bar_ made sure that there were beverages for any taste.

What an amazingly nice way to finish this project of! Thanks to all the engaged youths that have attended – and to all the awesome partners:
