## IMAGINING THE WORLD 5 YEARS FROM NOW. ALL THE TIME, EVERY TIME.

_On October 9, Aarhus Futura celebrated digital culture through a series of small events, bringing together a global community of artists, scientists, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, activists and audiences. A part of the program was presented in collaboration with SWEET CITY._

From 13:00 to 18:00 two of the events took place at Frontløberne – amongst other things, confronting questions of how to shape Aarhus as a city approaching new challenges and potentials in a digital age.

_13:00-15:00 in the common room:_
_Aarhus as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)_

At the dawn of this new era, we need to set the course for our digital society to remain committed to fundamental values such as freedom, democracy, equal opportunities and human rights, and to build lifelong learning communities that work together in solidarity.

Our activities are always guided by the question of what new technologies mean for our lives. We never ask what technology can or will do, but always what it should do for us.

As part of our efforts to spread knowledge, Aarhus Futura is proud to include an educational track in our program.

Hosted by _Jędrzej Silczak (Jedi for short)_, a developer, engineer, copywriter, and polyglot. Jedi has been working in the field of blockchain technologies since 2017, developing content strategies and technical documentation for numerous projects related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

In his keynote he covered the following topics:

- An introduction to blockchain technologies.
- Relevant cryptocurrency projects,
- Definition of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
- Current and future decentralization opportunities offered by this fast growing industry, followed by a Q&A session with enough time to satisfy your inner curiosity about this technological field.

_14:00-18:00 in the 3rd Space_
_Dive in the Metaverse_

In parallel with this educational offering, invited us to immerse yourself in the Metaverse.
Have you ever felt the need to dive into a movie?

Have you ever experienced how the music in your headphones becomes a part of you and your pulse seems to match the beat of a track?

What if you could be part of an event where you are one with the experience and your actions help create new digital art?

Dive in the Metaverse served a feast for the senses inviting us to let go of our reality using generative music and visual technology to translate the physical presence into the digital world.
