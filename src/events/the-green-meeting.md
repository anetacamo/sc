## LET'S HAVE THE BIG CONVERSATION ABOUT CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY!

_The local elections might be the last chance to vote for politicains that in due time can act upon the climate changes. In four years, we might be too close to the 1,5 degree mark that the climate scientists warn us against._

We need to address these big questions right here and right now. Together with the parties that are aiming to set the course for the coming years. We need to under stand what Aarhus Kommune can do to affect the global climate crisis – and we need to enter into dialogue with our local politicians.

Therefore, Den Grønne Studenterbevægelse (The Green Student's Movement) and SWEET CITY host a drop in political meeting with local politicians and young Aarhusians in The Dome from 15:00 to 20:00.

The political meeting will consist of expert presentations, conversations with politicians and concerts. The framework of the conversations will be Den Grønne Studenterbevægelse's four "B"s: bæredygtigt byggeri (sustainable city development), biodiversitet (bviodiversity), bilfri midtby (car-free city center) and borgerinddragelse (political citizen involvement).
