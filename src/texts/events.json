    "text": "## IMAGINING THE WORLD 5 YEARS FROM NOW. ALL THE TIME, EVERY TIME.\n\n_On October 9, Aarhus Futura celebrated digital culture through a series of small events, bringing together a global community of artists, scientists, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, activists and audiences. A part of the program was presented in collaboration with SWEET CITY._\n\nFrom 13:00 to 18:00 two of the events took place at Frontl√∏berne ‚Äì amongst other things, confronting questions of how to shape Aarhus as a city approaching new challenges and potentials in a digital age.\n\n_13:00-15:00 in the common room:_\n_Aarhus as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)_\n\nAt the dawn of this new era, we need to set the course for our digital society to remain committed to fundamental values such as freedom, democracy, equal opportunities and human rights, and to build lifelong learning communities that work together in solidarity.\n\nOur activities are always guided by the question of what new technologies mean for our lives. We never ask what technology can or will do, but always what it should do for us.\n\nAs part of our efforts to spread knowledge, Aarhus Futura is proud to include an educational track in our program.\n\nHosted by _Jƒôdrzej Silczak (Jedi for short)_, a developer, engineer, copywriter, and polyglot. Jedi has been working in the field of blockchain technologies since 2017, developing content strategies and technical documentation for numerous projects related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn his keynote he covered the following topics:\n\n- An introduction to blockchain technologies.\n- Relevant cryptocurrency projects,\n- Definition of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n- Current and future decentralization opportunities offered by this fast growing industry, followed by a Q&A session with enough time to satisfy your inner curiosity about this technological field.\n\n_14:00-18:00 in the 3rd Space_\n_Dive in the Metaverse_\n\nIn parallel with this educational offering, invited us to immerse yourself in the Metaverse.\nHave you ever felt the need to dive into a movie?\n\nHave you ever experienced how the music in your headphones becomes a part of you and your pulse seems to match the beat of a track?\n\nWhat if you could be part of an event where you are one with the experience and your actions help create new digital art?\n\nDive in the Metaverse served a feast for the senses inviting us to let go of our reality using generative music and visual technology to translate the physical presence into the digital world.\n¬¥\n\nThis immersive experience was been co-created by Dystopian Creatives and Alex Newman.\n"

    "text": "## THE GROWTH LAYER CULTURE OF AARHUS\n\n_ In the grand and historic setting of Ridehuset, the FLUKHX Meeting brougt together youth cultural agents, municipal art centres and politicians of Aarhus. In this meeting, together we confronted questions such as: What do we meen when we talk about growth layer culture (v√¶kstlag)? Who has access to it? Where is it going? And how do we together qualify and strengthen the unique, cultural communities of Aarhus?_\n\nThe conversation was moderated by Astrid and Peter from Urban Goods and it unfolded in three stages:\n_1. Culture and accessibility:_ How do we create a coherent city of culture that encourages and enables everyone to engage?\n_2. Mapping the cultural landscape of Aarhus:_ Where do we go and how do we connect?\n_3. The cross-disciplinary:_ Entrepreneurship and growth layer culture. How do we create a sustainable cultural environment?\n\nAll of this was framed by artistic intermezzos from the viola player Kirsten Buus Szakacs as well as the choir Clemens Knejterne.\n\n_Heat 1: Culture and accessibility_\nJesper Mardahl from PROMUS, Daniel Aneto from 8000 Stories and Andr√© Thelin from SKATEDUCATE contributed amongst others. Some of the main take-outs were that we are already working on a better integration between growth layer agents and the municipal centres as well as settled culture institutions. This important work has to elevated and highlighted even better in order to ensure accessibility for cultural agents on all levels. We also face a big challenge in terms of bridging the big cultural gap between central Aarhus and the surrounding parts of the city.\n\n_Heat 2: Mapping the cultural landscape of Aarhus_\nIn this session, the gathering interacted with a big map of Aarhus. People were incouraged to mark where in the city they feel inspired, challenged, entertained and so on. This led to workshops and conversations about specific parts of the city such as Riis Skov, Aarhus K, Aarhus √ò and Sydhavnen. See the map in the photos.\n\n_Heat 3: The cross-disciplinary_\nLaura Ellen Charlotte Carlsen from Aarhus Volume, Ole J√∏rgensen from ARoS Public, Camilla Aneto from det turkise telt, Beatriz Gonzalez Rodriguez from UAC Art Platform, Raffael Bender and Jesper Kjeldsen from Socialdemokratiet contributed amongst others. The discussion was centered around the struggles of breaking through the glass roof of the culture business. It is a hard game to be in ‚Äì and people have to be willing to fail and invest everything to get through the eye of the needle. Both monitary, cultural as well as social capital is invested as an up-and-coming cultural entrepreneur. We talked about how cross-disciplinary and sectoral cooperation can open new possibilities, we talked about the obligations and abilities of the big cultural institutions of Aarhus to nourish growth layer agents, and finally we talked about the prioritization of the municipal culture budget (do too much money end up in too few institutions?).\n"

In many other municipalities, these projects are run primarily by private investors.\n- The municipality even has a policy on how to make these processes as inclusive for the inhabitants of Aarhus as possible: _\"The Aarhus Model for Inhabitant Involvement 2004\"_.\n- Amongst other things, this policy dictates that a developmental project should involve inhabitants early and in many stages - through a general \"municipal plan\", a \"comprehensive plan\" and a \"local plan\". These steps often also include a \"development plan\" and always specific, administrative \"construction cases\" before construction can take place.\n- All of this is a long and thorough process. A duration from start to finish of 10-20 years is not unusual.\n- Britta encourages everyone to participate in the democratic process of these plans. Both by attending the \"physical citizen meetings\" (of which there will be at least two) and by writing a hearing comment through www.deltag.aarhus.dk\n\n_Christian Juul Wendell_, CCO and chairperson of Institute of (X), also attended the policy lab and gave good advice on how to affect the development of an area - within and outside of the democratic infrastructure provided by the municipality.\n\n_Take-aways from Christian¬¥s presentation:_\n\n- Use the temporary as your advantage: Cooperate with the developmental department around temporary activity that can create value.\n- Be a stone in the shoe: Be critical and keep the politicians accountable. Often they formulate nice visions for areas. Make sure that you remind them to live up to them.\n- Find your municipal heroes: Establish good cooperation with keypersons such as politicians and officials. Invite them to a cup of coffee and help them to understand how they can help you.\n- Hack public space: Make the public space nicer for yourself and your neighboor. Inhabit the public space with culture and influence what is possible.\n- Active construction fence: Temporary use does not have to end when construction begins. A fence surrounding the construction site can be made by culture containers, a graffiti wall or a gallery wall.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, the participants brainstormed on concerns and dreams regarding the development of Amtssygehuset - as well as actions that the municipality could take as well as them as citizens. The results looked like this:\n"

Quite a bit, and we'll show you why you should care about the regional elections\n\n[Register for the workshop here](https://9uwfeiwfk89.typeform.com/to/hgqlt1h5)\n\nMany people are interested in the municipal elections but don't really get the regional elections. \"Doesn't the region just strictly work with the hospitals? ‚Äì and do they even have any focus on the youth?\" You might ask yourself these kinds of questions as we are approaching the local elections where we have to cast to votes: one for the municipality and one for the region.\n\nIn this political meeting we want to show you, that regional politics should concern you quite a bit. In collaboration with Samfundsformerne and Region Midtjylland, we invite you to a special evening at UKH where we'll get to know eachother (and the region!) a bit better.\n\nThe evening will be finished off with awesome _poetry slam from Jakob Lund_ and delicious _Iranian food by Marcelle Rostami Lund_.\n\nThe event is from 17 to 20 and it is completely free of charge ‚Äì you just need to register.\n"
