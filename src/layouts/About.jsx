          <p>
            Approaching the local elections in November 2021, Sweet City is a
            project that facilitates dialogue and amplifies the dreams and
            criticisms of the Aarhusian youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Aarhus, more than 45% of the population are under 30 years old.
            Aarhus is the most youthful city in Denmark. And yet, too many young
            people donâ€™t feel heard and prioritized in the city development and
            the political debate. We are here to change that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only by engaging, you can make a change. There are many ways to
            shape a better world and in Sweet City we do it by engaging in the
            political debate, by creating new political foras and by talking in
            new ways.
