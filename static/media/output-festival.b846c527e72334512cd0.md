## Young artists debuted in abundance – and we exhibited the youth's take on the most urgent political agendas on artistic election posters

In october the artistic, youth celebration OUTPUT Festival took place. As a part of the festival, we exhibited a bunch of election posters created by young Aarhusians as a political commentary on the usual aesthetics of politics – showcasing their most urgent political agendas.

The posters have been developed through three workshops at Ungdomskulturhuset - UKH, Aarhus Billede- og Medieskole, and Skolen for Kunst og Design.
