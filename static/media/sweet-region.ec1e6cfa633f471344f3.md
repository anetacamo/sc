## Does the region even concern me? Quite a bit, and we'll show you why you should care about the regional elections

[Register for the workshop here](https://9uwfeiwfk89.typeform.com/to/hgqlt1h5)

Many people are interested in the municipal elections but don't really get the regional elections. "Doesn't the region just strictly work with the hospitals? – and do they even have any focus on the youth?" You might ask yourself these kinds of questions as we are approaching the local elections where we have to cast to votes: one for the municipality and one for the region.

In this political meeting we want to show you, that regional politics should concern you quite a bit. In collaboration with Samfundsformerne and Region Midtjylland, we invite you to a special evening at UKH where we'll get to know eachother (and the region!) a bit better.

The evening will be finished off with awesome _poetry slam from Jakob Lund_ and delicious _Iranian food by Marcelle Rostami Lund_.

The event is from 17 to 20 and it is completely free of charge – you just need to register.
