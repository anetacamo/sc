## EXPRESS YOUR DREAMS AND BELIEFS ARTISTICALLY BY HACKING THE BORING OLD ELECTION POSTER.

Along with a host of art schools and experienced artists, we explored visual arts as a medium for political thinking and expression. Together we created alternative election posters as a comment to the municipal policies and political communication.

On October 23 (the day the politicians put up their election posters) we will put up and exhibit our creative posters.
