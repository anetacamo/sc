## TAKE DATA BY THE HORNS AND MAKE IT AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ENABLING YOUR BELIEFS AND PROJECTS.

_WHAT?_
On this edition of the Policy Labs of SWEET CITY, we invited Aarhus' youth to boost their initiatives and support their cause more effectively in ways that also sharpen up their political thought.

_HOW?_
We will tapped into your past and present experience making a project, joining an initiative or trying to defend a cause, and level it up with essential data-collection concepts and tools. Nothing fancy, everything useful.

_INTENTION OF THE WORKSHOP WAS TO_

- To facilitate a more friendly view on how data can benefit the project-making process
- To discover fresh overlaps between working on your cause and evaluating political content

_DESIRED OUTCOME_

- To provide a set of basic concepts and approaches to make the use of data more familiar
- To spark curiousity and confidence in the gradual use of data to improve projects
