### Aarhus Kommune is at the moment developing several areas of the city - e.g. Aarhus Ø, Aarhus K, Sydhavnen, not to mention Amtssygehuset.

#### On June 21, approaching a public hearing for the development plan of Amtssygehuset, a host of young inhabitans connected to Amtssygehuset met to discuss the development of the area.

The municipal project leader of the areal development, _Britta Lyager Degn_, was invited to present the anatomy of the development as well as the specific plan and the process from start to finish.

_Take-aways from Britta´s presentation:_

- It´s a unique thing in Aarhus that the municipality runs city development projects themselves. In many other municipalities, these projects are run primarily by private investors.
- The municipality even has a policy on how to make these processes as inclusive for the inhabitants of Aarhus as possible: _"The Aarhus Model for Inhabitant Involvement 2004"_.
- Amongst other things, this policy dictates that a developmental project should involve inhabitants early and in many stages - through a general "municipal plan", a "comprehensive plan" and a "local plan". These steps often also include a "development plan" and always specific, administrative "construction cases" before construction can take place.
- All of this is a long and thorough process. A duration from start to finish of 10-20 years is not unusual.
- Britta encourages everyone to participate in the democratic process of these plans. Both by attending the "physical citizen meetings" (of which there will be at least two) and by writing a hearing comment through www.deltag.aarhus.dk

_Christian Juul Wendell_, CCO and chairperson of Institute of (X), also attended the policy lab and gave good advice on how to affect the development of an area - within and outside of the democratic infrastructure provided by the municipality.

_Take-aways from Christian´s presentation:_

- Use the temporary as your advantage: Cooperate with the developmental department around temporary activity that can create value.
- Be a stone in the shoe: Be critical and keep the politicians accountable. Often they formulate nice visions for areas. Make sure that you remind them to live up to them.
- Find your municipal heroes: Establish good cooperation with keypersons such as politicians and officials. Invite them to a cup of coffee and help them to understand how they can help you.
- Hack public space: Make the public space nicer for yourself and your neighboor. Inhabit the public space with culture and influence what is possible.
- Active construction fence: Temporary use does not have to end when construction begins. A fence surrounding the construction site can be made by culture containers, a graffiti wall or a gallery wall.

At the end of the workshop, the participants brainstormed on concerns and dreams regarding the development of Amtssygehuset - as well as actions that the municipality could take as well as them as citizens. The results looked like this:
