## A democratic society requires citizens to have a political opinion and to engage with democratic practices: Do you feel like speeking out?

DO YOU FEEL LIKE SPEAKING OUT? was an interactive art installation, aiming to create a space where young people’s voices can resonate and be heard by both citizens and politicians.

The installation was exhibited at _the upper stair at DOKK1._ During the two days people came by and shared their voices, hopes and opinions and other listened to them as they were broadcasted out in the library.

The installation was created by _Beatriz Gonzalez Rodriguez_ for UAC - Useful Art for Communities: https://uacartplatform.com/
