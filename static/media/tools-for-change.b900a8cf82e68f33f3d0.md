## HOW TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIMES THROUGH ACTIVE HOPE, CONNECTIVITY, AND CREATIVE ACTIONS?

_A workshop for those concerned about the state of the world and the different challenges we are witnessing â€” climate, social, political - with the need to explore their role and agency in contributing to positive change._

In this experiential, participatory and engaging workshop we:

- re-connected with oneself and others in a supportive environment
- explored different democratic actions that by-pass electoral politics
- explored our role in collective transition towards a life-sustaining world
- gained tools and approaches that can be used to drive positive change at a personal and community level

The workshop was be facilitated by _Liene Jurgelane_.
An anthropologist, cultural practitioner, mentor, and facilitator that has been working at the intersection of arts, culture and education for over a decade. She curates learning spaces, events and artistic interventions that resonate with the challenges of our times and invite to re-connect with oneself and others as a foundation for bringing positive transformational change. The main focus of her work and practice is exploring the relationships between community, creativity, well-being, and environment. She has worked with artists, activists, cultural collectives and institutions across Europe and is the co-founder of the educational collective new visions.
